                    OPTICAL STATES WITH HIGHER STELLAR RANK
                     (https://doi.org/10.1234/placeholder)

Quantum non-Gaussian states of traveling light fields are crucial components 
of quantum information processing protocols; however, their preparation is
experimentally challenging. 

Runtime environment

  To create the runtime environment, run

    python -m venv runtime
    runtime/bin/python -m pip install -r project/requirements.pip

  where the installation of mpi4py might require additional tools available in
  the environment. Please see its documentation for details.

Execution

  The numerical simulation of the state preparation protocol is contained
  within the 'unified' directory. The implementation supports parallel
  evaluation through mpi4py. 

  Even if using a single compute process, the simulation must be started
  through mpirun. Refer to 'unified/README' for further details.

  The figures presented within the manuscript can be reconstructed using the
  scripts contained inside the 'figures' directory. Refer to 'figures/README'
  for additional details.

Readily available datasets

  This repository contains precomputed datasets within 'results' directory. The
  figures presented within the published manuscript can be reconstructed from
  this data. Please refer to the 'figures' directory for the relevant scripts.

Components and modules

  This repository contains several Python modules, divided by the functions
  they provide. 

  (1) circuit

      As the name suggests, this module implements the semi-analytical model of
      the optical state preparation circuit.

  (2) helpers

      Provides several helper and utility functions. Includes wrappers for
      reading and writing compressed pickles. Implements a task dispatched with
      progress monitoring used in the simulations.

  (3) stellar

      Provides the threshold curve representing the hierarchical witness of
      genuine quantum non-Gaussianity (5). The points of the interpolating
      curve were determined using the method described in (6). 

      The curve constrains a relation between a pair of computed quantities
      determined from the photon number probability distribution of a quantum
      state with a given stellar rank.

      The particular threshold curve can be replaced with other criteria.

  (4) certify

      Implements certification of the simulated states. Ascertains whether an
      ensemble of states, characterized by the means and standard deviations of
      the computed quantities, lies sufficiently far from the threshold.

  (5) unified/unified

      Implements the actual simulation. Refer to 'unified/README' for
      additional details.

Testing the implemented semi-analytical model
  
  runtime/bin/python -m pytest -v
