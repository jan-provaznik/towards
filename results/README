This directory contains the precomputed datasets used to construct the figures
presented within the published manuscript. Please refer to the '../figures'
directory for the relevant scripts.

The individual datasets comprise several files (type D) corresponding to
different heralding detectors and post-selection outcomes. A pair of
accompanying files (type P) represents the parameters used in the
simulation.

All the files within the dataset are pickled and compressed np.ndarray objects.
The compression uses the zstandard algorithm. The files can be inflated and
depickled with the utility function 'zstd_pickle_load' from 'helpers' module.

The first two indices of the arrays correspond to the transmission rates of the
loss channels in heralding (1st) and characterization (2nd). The third index
translates to the information about the optimal state.

  (0) the maximal probability of success (maximized with respect to a
      squeezing rate that passes the stellar certification)
  (1) the corresponding squeezing rate
  (2) computed quantity X, ensemble mean
  (3) computed quantity X, ensemble std
  (4) computed quantity Y, ensemble mean
  (5) computed quantity Y, ensemble std

Example use

  Z = zstd_pickle_load('zspace.pickle.zstd')
  D = zstd_pickle_load('pnrd_pnrd_04.pickle.zstd')

  for i1, i2 in np.ndindex(Z.size, Z.size):
      zeta1 = Z[i1] # ... heralding transmission rate
      zeta2 = Z[i2] # ... characterization transmission rate

      succ = D[i1, i2, 0] # ... the maximal probability of success
      rate = D[i1, i2, 1] # ... the corresponding squeezing rate
