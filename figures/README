Reconstruct the plots and figures presented within the manuscript.

(1) figure-2 produces the illustration of the certification process
(2) figure-3 produces the mosaic plots illustrating the maximal probability of
    successful preparation of certifiable 4 and 5-PQnG states for different
    combinations of heralding and characterization loss.
(3) figure-4 establishes a relationship between the heralding and
    characterization loss, giving a boundary for experimentally reproducible 
    3, 4, and 5-PQnG states

With the runtime virtual environment ready (see ../README) execute

  ../runtime/bin/python figure-2.py
  ../runtime/bin/python figure-3.py
  ../runtime/bin/python figure-4.py

to produce the plots using the information previously collected in the
numerical simulations.
